# Telecom-Churn-analysis-using-Power-Bi

ðŸ”¹Telecom churn, also known as customer churn or subscriber churn, refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services with a telecommunications 
company and switch to a competitor or terminate their subscription altogether. It is a metric used to measure the rate at which customers leave or "churn out" from 
a telecom service provider. ðŸ’¼

Here's a glimpse of what my Power BI dashboard offers:
ðŸ“Œ Demographic Analysis: The dashboard provides an overview of customer churn based on age and gender.

ðŸ“Œ Geographic Insights: The dashboard includes data on customer churn by city. This information allows you to examine regional variations in churn rates.

ðŸ“Œ Revenue Analysis: The dashboard presents the average maximum and minimum values of total revenue, charges, and refunds. By analyzing these metrics, 
you can gain insights into the financial impact of churn.

ðŸ“Œ Streaming Preferences: The dashboard includes information about customers' streaming choices, such as movies, music, and TV. 
This data can be valuable in understanding customer behavior and preferences.

ðŸ“Œ Identifying Churn Patterns: By correlating various data points, such as age, gender, geographic location, and streaming preferences, 
you can identify patterns or factors that contribute to churn.

ðŸ“ŒMonitoring Churn Rate: The dashboard should display the overall churn rate, allowing you to track churn trends over time.

ðŸ“Œ And much more! ðŸ“Š

Utilizing Power BI's intuitive interface and interactive visualizations, I was able to provide a clear picture of telecom churn analysis that can fuel 
informed decision-making. ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¡
